metas-ts: renamed this file from KEYSTORE_REQUIRED.txt to KEYSTORE_CURRENTLY_NOT_REQUIRED.txt, because right now we are not interested in applets or signing code, but 
it took me a lot of effort to get there and i would like to keep it around for future reference.			

			
If the file KEYSTORE_REQUIRED.txt is present in a child project, then we assume that some code needs to be signed.
Therefore, the parent-pom profile with id "prepare-code-signing" activates to download our keystores, 
unack them into the "${project.build.directory}/keystore" folder
and set's properties so that e.g. the printing client applet can be singned with our "developement" signature.
Note that:
* these default properties can be overridden from outside.
* our "development" signature is not verified by a CA and is therefore not meant to be rolled out at the customer.
* the actual signing does not take place in this profile, because different projects will sign different files (and might even use the keystore with different plugins).
