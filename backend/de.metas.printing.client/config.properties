# Note about trailing white spaces:
# we don't want things like the endpoint URL to be screwed up by trailing white spaces in the properties file, 
# when loading properties from this so we trim their values.

# Quoting:
#   "The property value is generally terminated by the end of the line. White space following the property value is not ignored, and is treated as part of the property value."
