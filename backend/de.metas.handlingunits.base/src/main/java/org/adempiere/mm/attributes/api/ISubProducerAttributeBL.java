	 * Change values of the ADR attribute that is related with the sub-producer (if and when there will be more than 1 implementation, pls move this specific information to other places so that the javadoc is correct while also being informative).
	 * <p>
	 * If the given attribute set has no ADR attribute, then do nothing.
	 * <p>
	 * Retrieve the partner (i.e. the actual sup-producer) from the attribute set's subProducer attribute, falling back to HU's bpartner. If there is none, set the ADR attribute to <code>null</code>
	 * <p>
	 * If called with <code>subProducerInitialized==true</code>, then don't overwrite pre-existing ADR attribute values, but only set them if there aren't values set yet. This behavior is supposed to
	 * prevent us from loosing attribute values that were explicitly set while the sub-producer was not yet set or propagated. See task <a

	 * bug that happens if we <i>always</i> reset/recalculate the attributes. On the other hand, if the subproducer changes, from one not-empty value to another one, then we reset the ADR attribute to
	 * the new partner's value.

	 * @param ctx
	 * @param attributeSet
	 * @param subProducerJustInitialized <code>true</code> if the subProducer was changed from 0/null to an actual value.
