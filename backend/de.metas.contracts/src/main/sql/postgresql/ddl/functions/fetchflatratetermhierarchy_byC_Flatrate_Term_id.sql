comment on function de_metas_contracts.fetchflatratetermhierarchy_byC_Flatrate_Term_id(numeric) is 'This function returns the hierachy chain of a contract. It starts from the initial contract (which is provided by function fetchInitialC_Flatrate_term_ID) and goes recursivelly building the inheritence tree and put it in an array. The function only looks foraward, based on the link current.c_flatrateterm_next_id = next.c_flatrate_term_id
E.g. We have next inheritence tree: 1000281->1000282->1000283->1000284->1000285. If we run for 1000281 the result is  1000281;{1000281,1000282,1000283,1000284,1000285,NULL}. If we run for 1000283 or 1000285, the result is 1000281;{1000281,1000282,1000283,1000284,1000285,NULL}. So same as before, since is the same inheritance tree. Regardless of the point in the tree from where you start, the inheritence tree must be all the time the same.';
