This addon add features related to long-running BPartner-contracts.

In particular this includes
*"Subscriptions" with regular outgoing shipments
*"FlatFees" where regular orders (and shipments) are invoiced based on a flatrate schema (and not based on their actual price and qty)
*"HoldingFees" where there is no delivery, but a recurring fee like in rents
