/**
 * Provides a thread local context.<br>
 * Child threads get a fresh context, with the parent thread's context for default values.<br>
 * Therefore the child thread has all the parent's properties and can alter them for its own use (including an invocation of {@link Env#setCtx(Properties)}), but the alterations won't affect the
 * parent's context. Note that the child thread will even have read-access to context values that were set in the parent after it was spawned.<br>
 * The goal of this implementation is to avoid context pollution.
