/**
 * Transaction constraints can be defined on a per-thread basis and are enforced by the system. A user can obtain her
 * constraints instance by calling {@link org.compiere.util.DB#getConstraints()} and can then customize that instance
 * for the particular thread's needs.
 * <p>
 * <b>Motivation:</b>
 * <p>
 * Within ADempiere, we should have a way to enforce trx-Constraints to guard against misbehaving code which might
 * otherwise affect the overall runtime stability of the system.<br>
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When implementing a new process, we want to make sure that there is no unexpected stuff taking place outside of
 * the "main" transaction (e.g. in custom model validators).
 * <li>When working on complex issues (e.g. GUIs with a lot of callouts), we want to make sure that no open transactions
 * are left behind to block further database access
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Therefore we need to specify (e.g.) that there may only be a limited number of transactions opened from the current
 * thread at the same time. Or a limited number of save points per transaction. Or, that all transactions opened by a
 * given thread have to be finished (committed or rolled back) within a given timeout.
 * 
 * @see org.compiere.util.DB#getConstraints()
