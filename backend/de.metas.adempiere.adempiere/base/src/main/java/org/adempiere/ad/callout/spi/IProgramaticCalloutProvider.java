/**
 * Instances can be used to register callouts "programatically", i.e. not by database.
 * The preferred way to obtain an instance of this interface is to subclass {@link AbstractModuleInterceptor} and override its {@link AbstractModuleInterceptor#registerCallouts(IProgramaticCalloutProvider) registerCallouts} method.<br>
 * In other words, programatic callouts should be registered per-module and at one place within each module.<br>
 * However, since this interface extends {@link ISingletonService}, an instance can also be obtained via {@link de.metas.util.Services#get(Class)}.
