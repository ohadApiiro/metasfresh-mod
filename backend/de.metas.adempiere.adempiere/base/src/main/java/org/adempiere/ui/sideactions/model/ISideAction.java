/**
 * Side Action defintion.
 * 
 * A side action, is an item which can be part of a group of actions and can be displayed in a UI side bar.
 * The user can toggle a side action on/off or he can execute an side action.
 * 
 * Imagine this concept as a side panel in a window, where, based on context, some links or checkboxes are displayed and the user can run them.
 * That's a side action.
 * 
 * NOTE to developer: instead of implementing this interface, consider extending
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link ToggableSideAction} in case you want a toggable side action (i.e. a checkbox)
 * <li> {@link ExecutableSideAction} in case you want a clickable side action (i.e. a button/link)
 * </ul>
