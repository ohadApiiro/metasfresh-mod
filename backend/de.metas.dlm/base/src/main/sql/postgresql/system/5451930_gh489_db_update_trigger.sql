COMMENT ON VIEW dlm.triggers IS
'gh #235, #489: selects foreign key constraints and creates the DDL for a trigger and trigger-function that is analog to the respective FK constraint. 
The trigger checks if the referencing records are within the same DLM_Level (or are DLM''ed at all).
If this is not the case, then the trigger-function raises an exception with error-code: 
* 235D3 if the referencing table has a DLM_Level column, but with a highter value.
* 235N3 if the referncing table does not have a DLM_Level column.

In both cases, the change of the DLM_Level column of the referenced table is not allowed to happen, because it would mean that for metasfresh as seen from the referencing record,
the referened record would vanish.

Note that 23503 is an official error code, defined as "foreign_key_violation".
Also, please note that the "DETAIL" part of the exception that the trigger functions raise are parsed by metasfresh, so please be carefull when changing them and update the DLMExceptionWrapperTests unit tests accordingly';
