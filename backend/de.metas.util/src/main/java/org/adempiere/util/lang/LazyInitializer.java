/**
 * This {@link IReference} implementation provides a generic implementation of the lazy initialization pattern.
 *
 * Sometimes an application has to deal with an object only under certain circumstances, e.g. when the user selects a specific menu item or if a special event is received. If the creation of the
 * object is costly or the consumption of memory or other system resources is significant, it may make sense to defer the creation of this object until it is really needed. This is a use case for the
 * lazy initialization pattern.
 *
 * NOTE: this implementation is NOT thread safe.
