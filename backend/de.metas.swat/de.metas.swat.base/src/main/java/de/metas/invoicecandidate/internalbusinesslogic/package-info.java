/**
 * This package is about invoice candidate business logic.
 * Right now, it's mostly about quantities..e.g. compute the correct qtyToInoivce given such and such deliveries.
 * Before this package, the code was in different places such as {@link de.metas.invoicecandidate.api.IInvoiceCandBL}.
 *
 * In future, I would like to also migrate the price-related code to this place.
