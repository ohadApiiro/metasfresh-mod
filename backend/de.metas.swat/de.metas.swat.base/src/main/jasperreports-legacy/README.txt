The files in this folder used to be default files, but they are regularly ovewritte by endcustomer files, and they were rarely maintained.
Also, for time to time, some bugs in the build system caused them to be rolled out instead of their endcustomer-counterparts.

For those reasons, we are no moving them all into a "-legacy" folder, to be ignored by the build system from now on.
